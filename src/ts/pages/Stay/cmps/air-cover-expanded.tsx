                <h4>Booking Protection Guarantee</h4>
                <p>
                    In the unlikely event a Host needs to cancel your booking within 30 days of check-in, we’ll find you
                    a similar or better home, or we’ll refund you.
                </p>

                <h4>Check-In Guarantee</h4>
                <p>
                    If you can’t check into your home and the Host cannot resolve the issue, we’ll find you a similar or
                    better home for the length of your original stay, or we’ll refund you.
                </p>

                <h4>Get-What-You-Booked Guarantee</h4>
                <p>
                    If at any time during your stay you find your listing isn't as advertised—for example, the
                    refrigerator stops working and your Host can’t easily fix it, or it has fewer bedrooms than
                    listed—you'll have three days to report it and we’ll find you a similar or better home, or we’ll
                    refund you.

                <p>
                    If you ever feel unsafe, you’ll get priority access to specially-trained safety agents, day or
                    night.
